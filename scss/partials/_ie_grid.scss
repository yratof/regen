Stylesheet: IE Grid Styles

Since the example grid is based on media queries, so rather than
setup some js library that would make IE8 and below understand
media queries, let's just add some styles that serves a fixed grid.

Again, if you want to roll your own, just remove this junk and put
whatever you use in here.

$gutter: 100% / 36.2 !global;
$gutter_em: 1rem !global; // This needs to be rem to not mess up margins

// This calculate the gutter
@function col_width($n, $use_calc: false) {
	// We'll use a 12 column grid
	$divisor: 12 / $n;
	@if ($use_calc) {
		$gutter_offset: $gutter_em * ($divisor - 1);
		// We use 99.95% because ie10 isn't great at math.
		@return calc((99.95% - #{$gutter_offset}) / #{$divisor});
	}
	@else {
		@return (99.95% - $gutter * ($divisor - 1)) / $divisor;
	}
}
